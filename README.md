EntrepreneurSim is an API for a multiplayer simulation game where players can start and manage their own virtual businesses, making strategic decisions to grow and succeed in a competitive market.

## Game concept
In EntrepreneurSim, players begin with a small amount of capital and must find a job to earn income, with the goal of accumulating enough capital to start their own business. Once they have enough capital, they can decide which area of business to enter and will make decisions regarding product development, marketing strategies, pricing, and expansion plans. 

The game is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where players must actively engage to grow their business. Players must manage everyday necessities such as buying food to maintain energy levels (affecting productivity) and paying for transportation. The simulation also enables social dynamics, allowing players to interact with each other, form strategic partnerships, or compete in the same markets.
